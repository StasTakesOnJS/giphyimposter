# giphyimposter
Mini jQuery project to work with asynchronous requests to Giphy API, and also to get some basic practice with namespaces

The project is all in one script.js file, which includes two namespaces:

Search - the main search methods and click handlers
Elements - the DOM elements rendered with jQuery

If the project were to grow, the namespaces would likely have to be separated into different files
